# fortune-mod Maintenance Version and Ongoing Development

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/shlomif/fortune-mod.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/shlomif/fortune-mod)

This GitHub repository maintains the sources for fortune-mod, a
version of
[the UNIX fortune command](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_%28Unix%29).
`fortune` is a command-line utility which displays a random quotation from a
collection of quotes.

The canonical repository for the time being is:
https://github.com/shlomif/fortune-mod . In the future, we may create a GitHub
organization for it and move the sources there.

For more information about it you can contact
[Shlomi Fish](http://www.shlomifish.org/) .

## Sample usage

```
$ fortune
Enthusiasm is one of the most important
ingredients a volunteer project runs on.
                -- Andreas Schuldei
$
```

## History

I believe fortune-mod was originally forked from the NetBSD version of
fortune, and ported to run on Linux systems. For some time it was maintained
at the currently offline redellipse-dot-net inside a
[GNU Arch](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_arch) (= an old and now mostly
unused version control system) repository, and version 1.99.1 was released as
a tarball.

This maintenance version was initiated by Shlomi Fish, who decided to maintain
it out of being a fan of the fortune command. It started by importing the
unpacked source of the fortune-mod-1.99.1.tar tarball from the Mageia Linux
.src.rpm into an empty git repository and continuing from there.

# What was already done.

1. fortune-mod-1.99.1 was imported into the repository from the Mageia tarball
as the tag <code>fortune-mod-1.99.1</code>.

2. Cleaned up the build process a little.

3. Converted the source files to UTF-8.

4. Added a rudimentary "make check" target.

5. Removed trailing whitespace.

6. Reformatted long (> 80 chars) lines.

7. Fixed some typos.

8. Added [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/) support.

# What remains to be done.

1. See if there are any downstream patches to apply.

2. Add valgrind tests.

3. Add other tests.

4. Release fortune-mod-1.99.2.

5. Fix more typos (reports/pull-requests are welcome.)

6. Consider converting the build system to
[CMake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMake) or a different build system.
